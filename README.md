# Video-Anomaly-Detection

Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected
behavior, called outliers. It has many applications in business, from intrusion detection (identifying
strange patterns in network traffic that could signal a hack), system health monitoring (spotting a
malignant tumor in an MRI scan) to fraud detection in credit card transactions and fault detection
in operating environments.
We used MATLAB and python language in this project to refine and to extract features from raw data, to train
data, for testing new data, etc.
For feature extraction we used dynamic images (Source :https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00738). And from dynamic images we extracted Histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) features.
After preparing the training and testing dataset, we perform various algorithms like SVM, KNN and Alexnet, etc..
